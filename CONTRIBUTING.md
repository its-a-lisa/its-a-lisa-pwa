## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/EmaSuriano/gatsby-starter-mate/issues?q=something) to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and make one!

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork SeventeenSierra website](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

## Setting Up the Code for Local Development

1. Fork the `ss-site` repo on GitHub.
2. Create a branch for local development::

```bash
  $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

3. Install dependencies

```
  $ yarn
```

4. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

```bash
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
  $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

5. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

After the pull request is submitted, continuous integration is going to run all the automated tasks that ensure a minimum code quality. **This is a mandatory requirement in order to merge your pull request.**
